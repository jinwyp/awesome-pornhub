### How to promote and attract more stars on GitHub?

After Old Li finished reviewing the last line of text, he submitted it to GitHub and turned to his operations assistant, saying, "Let's see how it breaks through 1,000 stars within a week!"

The assistant asked, "Li, why are you so sure this thing will hit 1k stars? Many programmers struggle to reach a thousand!"

Old Li blew a smoke ring and replied, "Because they are doing projects on GitHub, while I am spreading information on GitHub. Can these two be the same? Just do as I say, and it will definitely catch fire."

The assistant, puzzled, couldn't digest it and stopped asking questions. Reflecting on his day's work:
- He collected a large amount of high-quality AI information sources.
- Categorized and organized the lists.
- Started a Git project, with Old Li emphasizing the use of "awesome," so the name became "awesome-aiinfo."
- After organizing the readme and getting Old Li's approval for adjustments, he published it.

Old Li went to Twitter and, leveraging his accumulated 1,000 followers, tweeted, "Discovered a great project! Compiled numerous noteworthy AI information sources! GitHub: ..."

After three days and less than 50 stars, the assistant asked Old Li, "Li, is this going to work?" Old Li, resolute, said, "Young man, don't rush it. Doesn't it take some time for people to notice it? Even good wine needs time to be appreciated!"

Old Li then submitted the project to A Sister and Ruan Yifeng. He submitted it and even took a screenshot to tweet, expressing hopes for more people to see the valuable information. It was like Liu Bei seeking Zhuge Liang's help; if the master doesn't come for me, it means the people of the world are waiting for the master's redemption!

Surprisingly, some friends found the project good and started sharing it. With followers ranging from thousands to tens of thousands, it gradually spread. By the fifth day, it trended and climbed to the top five, garnering over 3,000 stars.

The assistant, still puzzled, asked, "Li, why are so many people bookmarking this simple readme?"

This time, Old Li gave a lesson, "If you haven't done it, I tell you, you won't understand. Once you've done it, I tell you, you'll suddenly see the light. First, people have a tendency to collect things. When you see something useful, regardless of when you might use it, wouldn't you bookmark it first? Secondly, are the things we've organized plentiful enough? Are the categories clear enough? Those interested in art go to one section, those wanting to learn about models go to another? Lastly, does our aggregation save others time by providing a layer of curation?"

The assistant pondered, "Can we aggregate everything?"

Old Li smiled and said, "Of course, aggregation is about gathering information. Don't you spend time finding this information? You spend just once and share it, saving a lot of people's time. Next, let's take this to Xiaohongshu!"

The assistant's confidence soared, opening Pornhub to start categorizing his own collection, deciding to replicate Old Li's approach to sell high-quality information sources.
